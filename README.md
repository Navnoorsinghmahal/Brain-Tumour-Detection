# Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor detection. The CNN is trained to classify images into two categories: "tumor" and "no tumor". The project includes data augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `data_augmentation.py`: Script for augmenting the dataset (to be run before training the model).
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the CNN model.
- `view_model.py`: Script for evaluating and visualizing the model.
- `models/`: Directory where the trained models are saved.
- `logs/`: Directory for TensorBoard logs.
- `augmented_data/`: Directory containing the augmented dataset (generated by `data_augmentation.py`).
- `loss_plot.png`: Plot of the training and validation loss.
- `accuracy_plot.png`: Plot of the training and validation accuracy.
- `misclassification_0.png`, `misclassification_1.png`, etc.: Images showing misclassified samples.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pillow opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
